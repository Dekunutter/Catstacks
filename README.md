# Catstacks
Old dirty code backup of a small game I made a few years back.

It's not the most robust code in the world, nor is it very clean but I just wanted to push it somewhere before I lost it locally.

# Tech used?
It's coded in Java, with the graphics rendered via OpenGL ES 2.0.
I built everything from scratch, so outside of what Android provides there are no additional libraries used in this project
The game runs on its own threads so the main thread doesn't get congested. Game updated logic and the renderer are threaded separately.
